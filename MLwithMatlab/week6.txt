1. when prediction is not working:
  try: 1) collect more training samples;
      2) try smaller set of features;
      3) try getting new features;
      4) try decreasing/increasing regulization parameters.

2. How to evaluate a machine learning algorithm and how to improve? Machine learning diagnostics.

   Depends on bias or variances.
   1) High bias: underfit-> training error is high and crossvalidation is also high
   2) High variance: overfit -> training error is low and crossvalidation is high

3. Learning curves: can determine the problem is a high bias or a high variance problem. Then from this, can determine which furture actions to make.(adding/removing features, collecting more samples or not?, etc).


4. Machine learing system design:

   Error analysis

5. Skew data: one class is significantly smaller than the other class. So that even if the prediction error is very small, it is not necessarily good.

   use: recall(True positive rate, sensitivity) and precision 
    
   precision-recall curve

   F1 score.
