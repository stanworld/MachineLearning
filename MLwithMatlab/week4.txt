1. Neuron networks is essentially using multiple matrix multiplications to approximiate a non linear relationship between the input vector and the output vector.

2. The neuron unit is conducting logistic signoid function on the weighted input from previous layer.

3. Since the OR function, AND functions, etc can all be represented by a neuron network, then all the computational operations that can be represented by a bool operation can be represented by a neuron network.
